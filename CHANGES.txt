2007-08-03 Release 1.01

- Added yet another test data set; polygons from Zack Rusin's QT performance
  test (from http://ktown.kde.org/~zrusin/complex.data). These can be enabled
  by setting define QT_POLYGON_TEST in the TestApp[AGG|GDIplus].cpp and
  define INCLUDE_QT_DATA in TestPattern.c.

- A debug define (SUBPOLYGON_DEBUG) in subPolygon.h was accidentally left
  enabled. This caused some slowdown.
  
- An optimization define (USE_ASM_OPTIMIZATIONS) was accidentally disabled.
  This caused some slowdown as well.
